# Photo-Gallery

A photo gallery app developed with React that allows users to upload and view images in a sequential order. Users can easily manage their photo collection by uploading new pictures, which are displayed in the gallery, and deleting any images as needed. All images are stored in local storage, ensuring that your gallery remains organized and accessible directly from your browser.
